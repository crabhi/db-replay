= PostgreSQL DB replay

This tool allows to take a log of PostgreSQL queries and simulate the traffic
at a different database.

This is useful for load testing or if you want to move to a different database
implementation (such as moving from PostgreSQL to Cockroach).

The result is a file `replay.sqlite` that contains references to the queries
(as lines in the log file), timings and potential error message.


== Usage

1. Log all queries. This tool has been tested with the following configuration:

[source]
---
log_min_duration_statement = '0'        # -1 is disabled, 0 logs all statements
                                        # and their durations, > 0 logs only
                                        # statements running at least this number
                                        # of milliseconds

log_line_prefix = '%m [%p] %c %q%u@%d %x '            # special values:
                                        #   %a = application name
                                        #   %u = user name
                                        #   %d = database name
                                        #   %r = remote host and port
                                        #   %h = remote host
                                        #   %p = process ID
                                        #   %t = timestamp without milliseconds
                                        #   %m = timestamp with milliseconds
                                        #   %n = timestamp with milliseconds (as a Unix epoch)
                                        #   %i = command tag
                                        #   %e = SQL state
                                        #   %c = session ID
                                        #   %l = session line number
                                        #   %s = session start timestamp
                                        #   %v = virtual transaction ID
                                        #   %x = transaction ID (0 if none)
                                        #   %q = stop here in non-session
                                        #        processes
                                        #   %% = '%'
                                        # e.g. '<%u%%%d> '

2. Run it:

[source]
---
# Tell where to connect
export PGHOST=...
export PGUSER=...
export PGPASSWORD=...
export PGDATABASE=...

poetry shell

# Optionally, use --time-factor to slow down or speed up the queries.
python db_replay/replay.py --time-factor 0.02  postgresql-13-main-20220423.log postgresql-13-main-20220424.log
